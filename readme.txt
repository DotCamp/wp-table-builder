== Description ==

[Plugin Demo](https://wptablebuilder.com/demo-tables/) | [Documentation](https://wptablebuilder.com/docs/) | [Get Pro](https://wptablebuilder.com/pricing/)

WP Table Builder is a drag and drop table builder plugin for WordPress. It's insanely easy to create responsive tables with WP Table Builder.

WP Table Builder is perfect for creating comparison tables, pricing tables, list tables and many more.

The builder comes with 7 elements right now. You can add the following elements in a table:

* Text
* Image
* List
* Button
* Star Rating
* Custom HTML
* Shortcode

All the elements come with customization options of their own.

We have a cell management mode which comes with options like Add New Row, Add New Column, Merge Cells, Split Cells and many more.

## How to Use

After you install the plugin, you will see a Table Builder menu. Go to Table Builder > Add New. 

You will be able select column number and row number. Once you select that, click on Generate. The table will be generated. 

You can then drag and drop elements from the left panel into the table cells. Once you are done adding and editing elements, click on Save to save the tables.

After the table is saved, you can embed it in post and pages by using a shortcode. Click on 'Embed' on the top to get the shortcode. 

You can also get the shortcode from the 'All Tables' list under 'Table Builder' menu.

## Import Tables

You can import tables from CSV or XML files. You can import both single and multiple CSV or XML files. Multiple files will have to be zipped.

You can also import tables from TablePress plugin.

## Export Tables

Just like importing you can export the tables to CSV or XML files. 

If you are looking to move tables created with WP Table Builder to another site, XML is the better choice as it will preserve table settings.
